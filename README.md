# Sudoku Solver
First and foremost I want to apologise for bringing flash back onto the web. This sudoku solver was made in flash to try out some programming alrogithms.

The reason I added this is because even though Sudoku is a pretty standard programmer thing to show, it does show I've implemented programming techniques. To create a sudoku puzzle and to solve it, I've implemented backtracking, forward checking, ac3 checking, and the memento programming pattern.
